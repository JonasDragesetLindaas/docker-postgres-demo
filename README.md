## NTNU Virtual Machine Demo & Notes

This is a simple demo demonstrating a way to set-up a Spring backend and a PostgreSQL DB using Docker Compose.
Adapted and inspired by: https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/spring-postgres

Other PostgreSQL Docker samples: https://docs.docker.com/samples/postgres/

## Notes

"VM Presentation Notes" contains my notes for the demo, and includes several useful links.
